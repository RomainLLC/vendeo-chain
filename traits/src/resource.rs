	/// complex and too detailed to show in a search-results page or a list. Also, if a bird owns
	/// another bird, showing the full render of one bird inside the other's inventory might be a
	/// bit of a strain on the browser. For this reason, the thumb value can contain a URI to an
	/// image that is lighter and faster to load but representative of this resource.
